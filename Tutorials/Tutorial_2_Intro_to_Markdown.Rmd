This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. R Markdown is an easy and seamless way to integrate text with R code and output. The end result is a clean, professional, and easy-to-read document. Herein I will illustrate some common tips and functionalities that you should be familiar with. For more details on using R Markdown consult [this cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf), and for general details on Markdown formatting (not specific to R) consult this [cheat sheet](http://assemble.io/docs/Cheatsheet-Markdown.html).

When you create a new R Markdown Document, you were prompted to select a particular output format: .html, .pdf or .doc. Here I'm using the .pdf option. I recommend you also do this (it is required for your assignments). When you click the **Knit** button a document (of the pre-specified type) will be generated that includes both written content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

## R Code Chunks

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(ChickWeight)
```

Note that both the code and the output are generated in the resulting document. If you wish to display the output but hide the code, use the `echo = FALSE` command.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
summary(ChickWeight)
```

The output shown above is the same as the output that would have been displayed in the R console in a traditional workflow. The nice thing about R Markdown is that you can embed _any_ type of output, including plots. Let's embed a plot of `weight` vs. `time` from the `ChickWeight` data.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot(x = ChickWeight$Time, y = ChickWeight$weight, xlab = "Time (days)", ylab = "Weight (grams)", main = "Scatter plot of weight versus time")
```

This plot was rather large. By default, plots generated by code chunks are 7 inches wide. We can adjust the size of the embedded figure with the `fig.width` and `fig.height` commands. Let's make it 5 inches wide instead.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5}
plot(x = ChickWeight$Time, y = ChickWeight$weight, xlab = "Time (days)", ylab = "Weight (grams)", main = "Scatter plot of weight versus time")
```

That size is more appealing, but it's no longer centered. Let's center it using the `fig.align` command.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.align='center'}
plot(x = ChickWeight$Time, y = ChickWeight$weight, xlab = "Time (days)", ylab = "Weight (grams)", main = "Scatter plot of weight versus time")
```

Sometimes you may also want to embed code, but not the output. This can be done with the `eval = FALSE` command.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
summary(ChickWeight)
plot(x = ChickWeight$Time, y = ChickWeight$weight, xlab = "Time (days)", ylab = "Weight (grams)", main = "Scatter plot of weight versus time")
```

Sometimes you may want to include analysis in-line seamlessly in text. For instance you may wish to report that the mean chick weight is `r mean(ChickWeight$weight)` without having to hard-code it.

## Formatting

The previous section discussed how to interact with R within the Markdown Document. Markdowns are actually much more general, and learning how to format text in an .md file is a useful skill.

First, a bulleted list can be created using the asterisk as follows. Note that the empty line between this text and the bulleted list is crucial.

* Bullet 1
* Bullet 2
* Bullet 3

Second, a bulleted list with sub-items. Note that the double-tabbed indentation is crucial here.

* Bullet 1
    + sub-item 1
    + sub-item 2
* Bullet 2
* Bullet 3

A numbered list can simply be created using numbers. Again, the empty line is crucial here.

1. List item one
2. List item two
3. List item three

We can also create headings of various sizes using the pound (hashtag) symbol. Fewer hashtags create larger headings:

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
...

We can also bold, italicize and strikethrough text by prepending and appending asterisks, underscores, and tildes to your text:

* **This text is bold.**
* _This text is italicized_
* ~~This text has been stricken through~~
* __This text is underlined__

We can similarly turn text into code snippets by prepending and appending back ticks. `See, this looks like I typed it with a typewriter.`

A URL can be embedded into a Markdown document in one of two ways. We can display the URL directly: <http://guessthecorrelation.com/>, or we can hyperlink it through [some text](http://guessthecorrelation.com/).

You may also find it useful to insert page breaks so that certain content is displayed on separate pages. For instance, different parts of a question on an assignment. You can do this by typing the "newpage" command.

\newpage

## LaTeX

Especially on assignments it will be useful to embed equations and formulas into your Markdown document. This can be done using LaTeX commands directly in the .rmd file. For instance, we'll talk in a lot of detail about population attributes like the mean: $$a(\mathcal{P}) = \bar{y} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{u \in \mathcal{P}}{y_u}$$ and the median: $$a(\mathcal{P}) = Q_2 = \operatorname*{median}_{u \in \mathcal{P}}{y_u}.$$

For multi-line equations, you can use the "align" environment (or the "align*" environment, if you don't want each line to be numbered).

* Numbered:

\begin{align}
  a(\mathcal{P}) &= \bar{y} \\
                 &= \frac{1}{N}\sum_{u \in \mathcal{P}}{y_u}
\end{align}

* Non-numbered:

\begin{align*}
  a(\mathcal{P}) &= \bar{y} \\
                 &= \frac{1}{N}\sum_{u \in \mathcal{P}}{y_u}
\end{align*}

We can also combine in-line R code with LaTeX commands. For example, imagine in the `ChickWeight` dataset we regarded the chicks under study as a population and `weight` as the variate $y$. The population average weight and population median weight would then be respectively given by $\bar{y}=$ `r mean(ChickWeight$weight)` and $Q_2=$ `r median(ChickWeight$weight)`.
